## About
What makes people scheduling a medical appointment but not going?

The following dataset is composed by more than 110.475 medical appointments made in the city of Vitória, in the state of Spirito Santo (Brazil) between the 29th of April and the 8th of June 2016.

Around 20% of the people didn't showed up for the scheduled appointments, but is there any specific reason to it? Can we pinpoint the most important factors to know if someone will showup or not?

The findings here represented are tentative.
